<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Jiel</h1>

<h2 align="left">How I work</h2>
I'm motivated to do my best work to deliver projects that are jaw-dropping and impressive.  As I'm naturally curious, I like diving in deep to topics that interest me
and allow me to build elegant solutions.  I like to move fast but also enjoy the process and understand when I can't (it only means the concept or solution hasn't
clicked yet).  A deep thinker by nature, my brain is often tangled in thoughts and that's why I journal often and put the pen to paper.  If you want to learn more
about me, feel free to send me an email or connect with me on LinkedIn.
